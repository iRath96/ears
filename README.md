# EARS: Efficiency-Aware Russian Roulette and Splitting

![Teaser](/assets/teaser.jpg)

This repository contains the authors' Mitsuba implementation of the 
["Efficiency-Aware Russian Roulette and Splitting" algorithm](https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/publications/rath-sig2022.html).
We have implemented our algorithm in a recursive path tracer, which can be found under [`mitsuba/src/integrators/path/recursive_path.cpp`](/ears/blob/master/mitsuba/src/integrators/path/recursive_path.cpp).

## Parameters

The following parameters are supported by our `recursive_path` integrator:

### `rrsStrategy`
Choose from the following RRS techniques:
* `"noRR"`: No Russian roulette is performed
* `"classicRR"`: Russian roulette based on throughput (Mitsuba's default for path tracing)
* `"ADRR"`: Adjoint-driven Russian roulette
* `"ADRRS"`: Adjoint-driven Russian roulette and splitting
* `"EAR"`: Efficiency-aware Russian roulette (ours)
* `"EARS"`: Efficiency-aware Russian roulette and splitting (ours)

### `splittingMin` (default 0.05)
The minimum survival probability of a path. Can be set to zero for `classicRR`.
When using learning-based techniques (ADRRS and EARS), this needs to be set to a value larger than zero (`0.05` tends to work well).
Otherwise, a faulty cache that erroneously predicts zero contribution in some region of the scene could cause bias by terminating all paths that land there.

### `splittingMax` (default 20)
The maximum number of splits performed at a point.
While higher values can help problematic regions (like caustics) converge faster, it can also lead to an explosion in the time required to render a single sample per pixel.

Note that we do not limit the breadth of rays (see _Adjoint-driven Russian Roulette and Splitting_), which in our experiments performed poorly for both ADRRS and our method.

### `rrDepth` (default 5)
The depth at which Russian roulette and splitting starts.
For `classicRR`, a value of `5` tends to perform well across scenes.
`ADRRS` requires a value of `2`, as Russian roulette and splitting should start directly after the first bounce.
Our method `EARS` requires a value of `1`, as our method benefits from performing RRS at the primary hitpoint.

### `budget` (default 30)
The time (in seconds) allocated for the render.
This does not include the time required for pre-passes.
In particular, ADRRS and EARS render albedo and surface normal denoising auxilaries before starting their render work.

Note that similar to _"Practical Path Guiding" in Production_, our rendering proceeds in iterations, the results of which are combined using inverse-variance based weighting to produce the final render.
This allows learning-based approaches (ADRRS and EARS) to collect sample statistics and update their data-structures inbetween iterations.
For more details, please consult our paper.

### Debugging AOVs
Our integrator supports outputting many insightful AOVs (e.g., average splitting factors at each depth, computation cost of each pixel, â€¦).
Since those cause overhead, we have disabled outputting them by default.
To enable them, define the preprocessor macro `EARS_INCLUDE_AOVS` either in your scons config or in the `recursive_path.cpp` source file.

## Compilation

To compile the Mitsuba code, please follow the instructions from the [Mitsuba documentation](http://mitsuba-renderer.org/docs.html) (sections 4.1.1 through 4.6). Since our new code uses C++11 features, a slightly more recent compiler and dependencies than reported in the mitsuba documentation may be required. We only support compiling mitsuba with the [scons](https://www.scons.org) build system, but we do support Python 3.

We tested our Mitsuba code on
- macOS (Monterey, `arm64`)
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04, `x64`)
